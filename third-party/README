This folder is where all third party code should go.

Each third party library should be in a separate folder and 
it should contain a license file for said library.

1. Compare all third-party licenses against the licenses on
   https://zerowing.corp.adobe.com/display/legalwiki/Open+Source+License+Guidelines+for+Technology+Development:
2. Always talk to your manager about the planned usage of third-party
   code before using it.
3. Avoid any licenses that aren’t green – this will make things go
   faster, and reduce risk. Third party licenses must be compatible
   with the Apache 2.0 license.
4. Make sure you and your manager read and understand all the
   requirements for any licenses, and make sure you comply with it
   including attributions.
5. For any licenses that are green and you understand the license
   requirements and have complied with them, you can check in the code
   (make sure to keep the license file and add the third-party info to
   the NOTICE file).
6. For any licenses that are yellow, red, not listed, or you can’t
   meet or understand the license/guidelines, work with your PGM and
   Legal team.
7. For any licenses that are not listed or red, work with your PGM and
   Legal team.
8. When in doubt, work with your PGM and Legal team.  It’s your
   responsibility to try and prevent unneeded risk for Adobe.
